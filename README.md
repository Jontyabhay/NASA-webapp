Hi Everyone 👋🏻,

This Project deals with the NASA open APIS and transforms them into a beautiful web application to showcase space related data. The application utilizes React frontend that communicates with a Node.js backend running Express.

**SETUP** 💻

1. Clone the repo in yoour code editor
2. Make sure the path in the terminal of your code editor points to nasa-app which is where the where the whole project sits.
3. Run the comand **npm install** to install the required dependancies.
4. Once installed, run the command **npm start** and it will navigate to the localhost port where your application will run

The following sections have been covrered for NASA open API:

1. **Astronomical Picture of the Day** 🪐
